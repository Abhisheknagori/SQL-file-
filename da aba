Data analytics and business analytics are related fields that use data to improve decision-making, but they have distinct focuses. Data analytics involves the process of examining raw data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights, often using statistical analysis and machine learning. Business analytics applies these insights to solve specific business problems, optimize processes, and drive strategic decisions. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
